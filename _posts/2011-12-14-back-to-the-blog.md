title: Back to the blog!

And so, after a many month hiatus, I'm writing another blog post. I think I've been inactive for three reasons:

1. **Work** - I'm running the DevOps group at CG (it's been nearly a year!) and things are always crazy busy there. I was even in Malaysia over the summer.
2. **School** - I started a [masters program at Columbia](http://ce.columbia.edu/Technology-Management) in September. This has been great, but it also takes a lot of time! Last night was our last class this semester. I guess this makes me 25% done?
3. **Blogging is Tough** - Not really. This is a lame excuse. But I just [wrote this script](https://gist.github.com/1479501) to help. Yeah, I know that people like to use rake files for this, but I felt that a shell script was more my style. 

Anyway, with this in place I hope to blog at least a little more often. I have some cool tech projects planned for my break. I'll keep you posted.
