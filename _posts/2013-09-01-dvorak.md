layout: default

I'm trying to make the switch to a Dvorak keyboard layout. So far, it seems nearly impossible. It takes me a lot longer to type something, but maybe it will help my hands and make me more mindful about how I type.

In other news, I wrote two programs last week and used acme for both. Maybe I can teach myself new tricks!
