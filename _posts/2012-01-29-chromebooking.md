Sometimes I would like to have something that would monitor what I did on my comptuer to tell me how I'm really using it. I think that if I did the answer to, "What are you doing on your computer?" would be: "Not much."

Really, I do a lot of things *with* my computer. I coordinate people around the world with email and chat, I write code, I create and manage hundreds of computers in different cloud environments. I write documents, reports, and diagrams. All this stuff happens somewhere else. I do a lot *with* my computer, but not much *on* it. 

So, I've decided to try an experiment. I'm shelving my Lenovo laptop running Ubuntu and switching to a Chromebook. I'm going to try to use it full time for as long as I can.

Today is day three. There's a lot to like about the Chromebook:

* It's simple. I don't spend time messing with it.
* It's fast. Both in boot speed and responsiveness while it's running. It feels faster than my other laptop.
* My data is not really on it, so it's backed up. I can store some files on it too, but ChromeOS sort of forces you to put the files online eventually.
* It's very connected. WiFi and 100MB of free 3G from Verizon each month. WiFi is all over the place these days, so being online is a pretty safe bet. Some apps can be offline too which will help.
* The battery is great. I probably got close to 7 or 8 hours on my first charge. We'll see if this keeps up. 

There are some challenges, and I think that if I switch back it will be because of these two things:

* *Lack of a good SSH client.* Yeah it has SSH, but it can't do key based authentication, key forwarding, and SCP. I use those tools a lot. Supposedly this may be addressed in a future release, so fingers crossed here.
* *No emacs.* If I could have an emacs install with tramp I think I may be fine. I'm using the [Cloud9 IDE](http://c9.io), which seems cool but I'm not sure if it's going to fit the bill. Another option is to SSH to some server and run emacs, which I'm not opposed to, but depends on better SSH support. 

I do like how it has already changed the way I work with my computer. When I reinstall my OS or get a new computer I usually spend a few hours importing settings and files, making sure things are just right, and configuring bits and pieces of the OS that are not perfect (network and video drivers I'm looking at you). 

With the Chromebook I didn't have to do any of that. I was up and running in about a minute. I'm also not spending time screwing around on changing themes or trying out dumb terminal tricks. I run out of stupid shit to do with this computer in about five minutes, which means I'm either working or walking away from the computer. All in all that's pretty good. 

I think the Chromebook will help me get in the mindset that I want to be in for the DevOps work I do at Control Group. All my tools, documentation, and work will already be in the cloud, so it's easy to collaborate. Because there's no way I can install compilers and build software locally I will have to think about integration and deployment from day one, which I think will increase collaboration.

The experience has already been refreshing. I have a good feeling that this will work out, and if it doesn't I know it will change the way I use my next computer.
