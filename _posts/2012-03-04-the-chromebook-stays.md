title: The Chromebook Stays!
---

It's been just over a month since I made my switch to the Chromebook. It's been the only computer that I've been using, so I'd say it's working out pretty well.

The battery life and simplicity are still the best parts. It's nice to have a simple laptop that always works and does just what I need. I'm not sure how, but I feel like I get more work done on the Chromebook (Maybe there are fewer distractions with it).

I have discovered that it does support key based authentication for SSH. I don't think I could have gotten by without that. I've been using EC2 to spin up a micro instance when I need to get some development work done in Emacs. 

I still wish the shell was a little more fully featured. If it had an SSH agent and scp I'd be able to save a lot of hassle.

In any case, it's still probably the best computer I've used in a while. I hope Google sticks with it, because at this point I'm not sure I would use anything else.
