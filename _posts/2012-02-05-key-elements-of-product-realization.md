title: Key Elements of Product Realization
---

This spring I'm taking a class about product realization that meets about one Saturday a month. Yesterday was the first class and we discussed a list of the top 20 things that are important to realizing a product. Here's the list:

1. Team
1. Communication
1. Design to Manufacture
1. Automation (design tools like CAD/CAM or CASE)
1. Professional Ethics
1. Creative Thinking
1. Design for Performance
1. Design for Reliability
1. Design for Safety
1. Concurrency of Design and Development
1. Sketching and Drawing
1. Design for Costs
1. Statistics and Metrics
1. Product Reliability
1. Tolerance
1. Value Engineering
1. Design Review
1. Build Processes
1. Systems Perspective
1. Maintainability

People are important and being creative is important. Lists like this make me realize that the BFA is actually the perfect training for product realization. I feel fortunate to be able to pull from that knowledge.

I'm surprised that safety is not higher on the list. When I was doing a lot of woodworking I had three priorities:

1. Be safe
1. Have fun
1. Be accurate

I suppose this is mostly because I was afraid of cutting my hand off, but with people relying more and more on the things we build, safety seems like it should be more important.

I look forward to learning more in this class and trying to apply more of my creative background to what I'm doing in the masters program.
